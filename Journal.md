# July 1st - The Schematic (2 Hours)
Determined the type of hackpad I wanted to do, by brainstorming ideas to make keyboards more versatile 

Started to experiment with Kicad schematics by following the tutorial while adding adding my own features such as the rotary encoder and ensured to assign all footprints

Completed the Schematic design

# July 2nd - The PCB (3 hours) 
Updated the PCB through the schematic I completed 

Wired all necessary components in the PCB editor

Added the 3D features and made sure they lined up through the 3D viewer

# July 3nd - The Case (8 hours)
Started to design the case, I wanted ensure the design fit the purpose of the hackpad so I decided to arrange the keys in a smiley face pattern

Began to build the case starting with the base made sure to keep track of dimentions to ensure to not run into any problems such as an uneven base

Filleted the corners and completed the bottom of the case

Then started the top cover uploaded the keypad file maintaing the smileyface design

Made sure to keep the same dimensions as the bottom base to snsure it would fit on properly

Cut out the space for the Xiao and Filleted the corners

Completing the top and base of the case =)

# July 4th - The Puzzle (5 hours)
Began to put everything together uploaded the PCB files and put it into the CAD to making sure everything fits

Cut out the hole for the rotary encoder

Lined up and readjusted any complications

Completing the Hackpad
